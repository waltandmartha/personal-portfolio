            Glenn has worked in a few different areas in the past but has always had an interest in the latest technology and new ideas. In 2018 Glenn began a bootcamp to learn all he could about coding. So far he has built a terminal app and this website, with much more to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously Glenn has worked as a librarian in public libraries for the last 11 years, and a cinema projectionist before that. He brings the skills he has developed over the years to his learning and future career. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            In his spare time Glenn enjoys catching live music, seeing friends, playing board games and learning new things. He also enjoys reading, he's always 
            reading books and articles.

            Blood Sugar Buddy, created in Ruby, is designed to be a cyber coach to diabetics. The user can enter their blood sugar levels and receive a response from the app, guiding them towards the appropriate action. The app has an encouraging tone so as to positively influence the user. 
        </p>

            Also included is a BMI calculator which tells the user if they fall within the normal range for their height/weight, and how this will impact their blood sugar control. 
        </p> 
        <p class="projects-text">
            The waist measurement feature is a quick guide to inform users that if the weight they carry is high around the waist then it could make their diabetes control more difficult.

        <p class="project-text1"> 
            Using only html and css, this website was designed, created and deployed in less than a week. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects-text-header"><i class="fab fa-react"></i> React Project</h2>
        <p class="project-text1">
            Working as part of a team we had 3 weeks to solve a problem for a real life client, using the MERN stack. Our client was Back 2 Bikes - a not-for-profit organisation that fixes and refurbishes bikes at an affordable cost while giving volunteers a place to work and practice their skills. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text1">
            This project wasn't as simple as it could have been as we had to work in an established code base as opposed to the other groups in our class that started new web apps from scratch. This presented some challenges including figuring out the structure of the current code and learning Meteor and Storybook. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text1">
            We got a lot done in the three weeks and ended up with more complete features than we expected. Our team made the parts ordering section which allows the user to add and remove parts from an order from a catalouge that displays the retail price calculated from the supplied wholesale price.
        </p>
        <h2 class="projects-text-header"><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Internship</h2>
        <p class="project-text1">
            At the end of our 6 month bootcamp at Coder Academy we were placed in a 4 week intership. I was based at Mystic Pants in Windsor with a handful of others from the course.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text1"> 
            Our task was to create an interface for people to register their new device (a button) and then set that device to perform an action of their choosing (send an email, sms, etc.) when it is activated (button pressed).
        </p>
            <img class="image" src="Assets/Images/cbutton-code-sample.png" alt="Small sample of code from cButton project.">
        <p class="projects-text">
            The back-end was already created so we had to design, create and deploy the front-end. We did this using React and Material UI. My tasks included creating the action form (a form that updated depending on which action was selected), the main menu and some error handling.
