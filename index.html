            Glenn has worked in a few different areas in the past but has always had an interest in the latest technology and new ideas. In 2018 Glenn began a bootcamp to learn all he could about coding. So far he has built a terminal app and this website, with much more to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously Glenn has worked as a librarian in public libraries for the last 11 years, and a cinema projectionist before that. He brings the skills he has developed over the years to his learning and future career. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            In his spare time Glenn enjoys catching live music, seeing friends, playing board games and learning new things. He also enjoys reading, he's always 
            reading books and articles.

                Blood Sugar Buddy, created in Ruby, is designed to be a cyber coach to diabetics. The user can enter their blood sugar levels and receive a response from the app, guiding them towards the appropriate action. The app has an encouraging tone so as to positively influence the user.

            The waist measurement feature is a quick guide to inform users that if the weight they carry is high around the waist then it could make their diabetes control more difficult.
