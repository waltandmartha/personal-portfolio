##Intended audience

The intended audience for this site is primarily potential employers. It is also a good introduction to me and my work to anyone else that may be interested. Maybe other coding students, or future students. I also hope to build on this website as my skills grow and develop and as I have more projects to add. 

##Design ideas
#Shapes
Last week I conpleted a YouTube tutorial 'skewed div' which split the screen diagonally. I liked the look of this and wanted to incorporate that angled feel into my design. My original idea was to habe angled bars that scroll over a static background/background image as the user scrolls. 
This got me then thinking of triangles, to keep consistent with the idea of slanted lines. A lot of sites are so straight and square I wanted to try and do something a little different. Playing around a bit with Figma, I tried various menu ideas to display at the top of the screen. I started with a rectangle divided it into 4 triangles. It didn't look that great, and I couldn't imagine how text might fit in there. I also tried 3 trianges - 2 smaller ones with a large one in the centre of the rectangle. This looked good but still didn't feel quite right. I then flipped it vertically so the middle triangle pointed up and this felt a lot better. I ended up removing the middle triangle and keeping the two side ones as menu buttons. The middle triangle, between the two menu triangles now just blends into the rest of the page below. 

#Colours
I spent a LOT of time on figure out which colours to use. I've always liked the idea of yellow with grey and white. I used those colours recently in a kitchen renovation and think they work well together. But after thinking about that for a while, and seeing some examples from previous students I thought that there were already too many yellow/grey designs around and I wanted to do something different. 
I looked around and added interesting colour combinations and designs to my pintrest. I remembered doing a tutorial in codepen and ending up with 2 colours accidentally sitting next to each other and liking how they looked together. Yellow and orange. It doesn't sound good, but it did look good. 
I thought about it more over the weekend and while at the Marimekko exhibition at the Bendigo Art Gallery I liked the colours on many of the dresses there. I took many photos of pieces of the exhibition so I could spend more time examining the colour conbinations later on. One of the fabrics had yellow, orange and white - which tied into what I was already thinking and did look like a nice combination. 
The next step was going onto the computer, adding colours in figma to see how they looked together and checking colour comparison websites to see if I could improve the colours or shades. After much time experimenting I was happy with my colours. I also thought about dropping the yellow and having orange, grey and white. Similar to the yellow, grey and white I love but with orange. I thought that looked quite good as well. In the early stages of playing around with colours I also tried adding dodgerblue (because everyone loves dodgerblue) but unfortunately it didn't make it in the end.
Even though black text was easiest to read on the yellow background I wanted to avoid black text if possible. I eventually decided to use the yellow and orange sparingly and stick to a white background most of the time. I do like grey though so I added an image on the landing page with lots of greys and a bit of yellow. I ended up using the yellow from that image as the yellow elsewhere on the site so it was consistently the same yellow.
